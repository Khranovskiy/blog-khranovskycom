Ideally you:

* Have a great work/file balance, rarey work more than 40 hours a week.
* Provide professional development opportunities.
* Don't require writing code on whiteboards in your interview process.
* Are not an outsourcing outstaffing agency or contractor.
* Stress-free culture (emotional and psyhological safety)
* No tools and tech that leads to anger, exaustion
* Not a “business logic” role
* Located somewhere I’d like to live (London, Netherlands)
* Or, is a thriving remote-friendly team (e.g. Buffer, GitLab, WordPress, etc)
* Or can offer me a radical career change (i.g. into distributed systems, machine learning)
* no burocracy, no agile scrum kanban cargo cult
* keep calm

Open to full time remote positions.
Please send me clear “Why me?” story.
